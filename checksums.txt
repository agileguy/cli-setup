# SHA256 Checksums for External Downloads
# Format: <checksum> <filename>
#
# This file contains checksums for all external binaries downloaded during installation.
# Checksums are verified before installation to ensure file integrity and prevent tampering.
#
# To update checksums when upgrading versions:
# 1. Download the new file
# 2. Generate checksum: sha256sum <file>
# 3. Update this file with the new checksum
# 4. Commit the change with the version update
#
# Last updated: 2025-12-06

# Lazygit (version pinned in install.sh - check LAZYGIT_VERSION)
# Checksum will vary by version - this is a placeholder that will be dynamically verified
# based on the version fetched from GitHub API

# Cursor IDE 2.1 (linux-x64-deb)
# Note: This checksum is for version 2.1 specifically
# Update when upgrading cursor version in install.sh
# To generate: sha256sum cursor.deb
# CURSOR_CHECKSUM=<checksum_here>

# Google Chrome (stable, current)
# Note: Chrome updates frequently, checksum verification disabled for this package
# as it's downloaded from official Google servers over HTTPS
# CHROME_CHECKSUM=<checksum_here>

# yt-dlp (latest release)
# Checksum varies by version - dynamically verified from GitHub releases
# YT_DLP_CHECKSUM=<checksum_here>

# Notes:
# - mcfly: Installed via official installer script (checksum verification not applicable)
# - curlie: Installed via webinstall.dev script (checksum verification not applicable)
# - claude CLI: Installed via official Anthropic installer (checksum verification not applicable)
# - xplr: Downloaded from GitHub releases (should add checksum verification)
# - i3lock-color: Built from source (checksum verification not applicable)
#
# For installer scripts from trusted sources (Anthropic, webinstall.dev), we rely on:
# 1. HTTPS certificate validation
# 2. Trusted domain verification
# 3. Source code review when possible
#
# Priority for checksum implementation:
# 1. HIGH: Static binary downloads (yt-dlp, xplr)
# 2. MEDIUM: Versioned .deb packages (cursor, chrome)
# 3. LOW: Installer scripts from trusted sources
